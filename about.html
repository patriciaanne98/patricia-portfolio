      <p class="about-bio">
        I grew up in a small town in Arkansas, surrounded by the warmth of my family’s Filipino restaurant. From a young age, I found myself designing menus, coordinating events, managing guests — and eventually, building the restaurant's website from scratch.
      </p>

      <p class="about-bio">
        My first steps into design weren’t in a studio — they were on the floor, serving customers, solving problems, and learning how experience shapes perception.
      </p>

      <p class="about-bio">
        At 14, I fell in love with digital spaces after customizing my Tumblr. I embedded music, played with code, and used visuals to tell stories — not knowing I was already thinking like a designer.
      </p>

      <p class="about-bio">
        In 2020, when the world slowed down, I found a new kind of movement. I became a certified Pilates instructor and started creating content to keep people grounded, connected, and well. It was during this time that I realized: design and wellness both require empathy, structure, and trust.
      </p>

      <p class="about-bio">
        I’m now a Junior at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, pursuing a degree in Web Design & Development with a minor in Information Science. I’ve designed for small businesses, been featured on Hulu’s <em>Small Business Revolution</em>, led over 300 Pilates classes, and am building a portfolio that blends my entrepreneurial grit with thoughtful, human-first design.
      </p>

      <p class="about-bio">
        My dream is to work in product design or product management — to help build digital experiences that feel intentional, intuitive, and real.
      </p>

      <p class="about-bio">
        I believe that design is more than just how things look — it’s how they move, how they speak, and how they make people feel. My mission is to bring that clarity, calm, and creativity into every project I touch.
